Confinement time: amount of time the plasma stays confined. For electricity generation, a high confinement time is required.

Deuterium: Hydrogen isotope containing a neutron, so it has double the mass of ordinary hydrogen. Uses the symbol D or 2H. Naturally occurring and plentiful.

Gain factor (uses symbol Q): ratio of power produced by fusion, to power required to produce it. Q=1 means a reactor is theoretically breaking even. Since energy leaks out in other ways, a value of Q=5 is needed for net energy production with current reactor designs. In theory a reaction can become fully self-sustaining (Q=infinity), meaning it requires no energy input to maintain it, while still producing energy. The current record is Q=0.67 by the JET Tokamak.

H-mode: high confinement mode. A more stable and better confined plasma state in magnetic confinement reactors. Not fully understood why it occurs.

Ignition: A self-sustaining plasma reaction. This is the golden final goal of fusion research because it would then require only fuel through deuterium and lithium to produce unlimited energy.

Lawson criterion: Net power = Efficiency × (Fusion − Radiation loss − Conduction loss)

Mass defect: Difference between the mass of a nucleus and the masses of its component parts. This mass difference is equivalent to energy (via Einstein's equation). If the single Nucleus weighs more, then theoretically energy can be released via fision (breaking it apart). If the single nucleus weighs less, then energy can be released via fusion (combining the component parts)

Q - see gain factor

Tritium (3H or T): Hydrogen with two neutrons, so it has triple the weight of ordinary Hydrogen. Radioactive with a half-life of 12 years. Rare and expensive to produce, but can be produced as a by-product of fusion (Lithium-6 + Neutron = Helium-4 + Tritium).
