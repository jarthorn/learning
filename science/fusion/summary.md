## Why fusion?

According to the IEA, 85% of global energy consumption comes from fossil fuels. Renewables are growing but are barely denting the growth rate of energy consumption from oil and natural gas. The world needs to drastically reduce carbon emissions, and fusion power is one of the few energy sources capable of replacing energy from fossil fuels over the long term. The major inputs to fusion reactions are isotopes of hydrogen and lithium, which are either abundant or can be produced onsite. The main by-product of fusion is helium, which is safe. Fusion energy is not a fringe idea: Most industrialized nations have large fusion research programs, and there are a growing number of privately funded fusion startups. Fusion downsides: There is some radioactive waste created in the metals used to confine the reactor, but this waste has a half-life in the 10's of years, rather than 10,000's of years for fission waste. Fusion technology is already proven, but not yet economically viable. Fusion experiments are vastly complex and can take decades to build and validate. At current funding levels, and without further major breakthroughs, it will likely be at least 30 years until commercial reactors are available. Even if you aren't interested in the future of humanity, fusion research is a deeply fascinating world of science and engineering problems that is worth exploring for the sheer nerd value. 

## How does Fusion work?

Fusion is a reaction that combines two or more nuclei to form a new nucleus. This is the opposite reaction from fission, which powers traditional nuclear energy plants. Fission involves breaking large nuclei into smaller parts. In both cases, the outputs of the reaction have less mass than the inputs, and the difference is released as energy. From Einstein's equation we know that a small mass translates into a large amount of energy. A basic fusion reaction powers our sun and other stars, where hydrogen nuclei fuse to form helium, generating heat and light. This reaction requires the high pressure of a star's gravity to induce, but there are other fusion reactions we can reproduce more easily on earth. To trigger fusion, the fuel needs to be heated to millions of degrees. This converts the fuel into a 4th state of matter called plasma. Once fusion starts, the reaction itself produces heat, so that vastly less or theoretically no external heating is required to sustain it once the plasma is burning.

The easiest fusion reaction to produce on earth combines hydrogen-2 (deuterium) and hydrogen-3 (tritium), producing helium, a free neutron, and a lot of heat. This reaction is known by the shorthand DT. In a secondary reaction, the free neutron is combined with lithium-7, to produce tritium and more helium. Other reactions are possible and there is active research into the best approach, but DT is the most viable option today. Since this reaction sequence produces its own tritium, and deuterium is abundant in water, the limiting fuel source is lithium. Fusion creates more energy per mass of fuel than any other source, a million times more efficient than fossil fuels. This means a small amount of fuel goes a long way. Current lithium supplies are sufficient for 100,000 years or more. Fusion reactions have also been created with deuterium alone, and although less efficient, with this method we have enough fuel on earth to last until beyond the death of our sun.

## What are the major categories of fusion reactors?

The central problem for a fusion reactor is how to confine the plasma, which is hotter than our sun and therefore no material can hold it (iron boils at 3K degrees for example). There are two major methods: inertial confinement fusion (ICF), and magnetic confinement fusion (MCF). ICF is not looking promising as an energy source, so I'll focus on MCF here. In MCF, the plasma is confined using a magnetic field. This is made efficient through the magic of superconductors, which can sustain a magnetic field with low power draw. The most popular design so far is the tokamak, first developed by soviet scientists in the 1950's. The world's  largest working fusion reactor is based on this design: Joint European Torus (JET). Another much larger tokamak, called ITER, is currently under construction. ITER is expected to be the first "net-positive" reactor that produces more energy than it consumes. Tokamaks have a major obstacle to continuous operation, that the plasma does not remain stable over time. The workaround is to run a DC current around the circumference of the plasma (poloidal current) to hold it in place. However this cannot be run continuously. The second most promising MCF design is called a stellarator (also the second coolest reactor name, after the perhapsatron). In a stellarator, computer modelling creates a complex plasma shape that is inherently stable, removing the need for a plasma current. There are major stellarator experiments ongoing, most notably the W7-X reactor in Germany. There are many other experimental directions being explored, including several variations on the tokamak: spherical tokamaks with almost no "hole" in the donut, and Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF) that produces plasma in a tokamak and then compresses it to increase the fusion reaction rate. All designs other than tokamaks and stellerators have significant obstacles and are unproven options today. This could change with further engineering breakthroughs.

## Is fusion safe?



## Can it be used for war?

Hydrogen bombs make use of nuclear fusion to magnify their destructive power. However, these bombs still use fission as the initial reaction required to produce the heat required to cause a fusion reaction to occur. Magnetic confinement does not have practical military applications. Inertial confinement involves use of massive lasers. These lasers could have military applications separate from their use in fusion reactions.

## How close are we to reaching practical use for energy production?

To measure progress you need clear metrics. There are three major metrics used by the fusion community: gain factor, fusion triple product, and plasma duration. Gain factor (using the symbol Q) simply represents the the energy output from fusion, divided by input energy required to create the plasma. A value of Q=1 means the reactor produces exactly the same energy that it uses. Due to the energy loss converting the reactor heat energy back into electricity (via steam turbine), Q needs to be at least 2-3 before it is truly energy-positive. The highest result from any fusion reactor so far is Q=0.67 from JET. The ITER is designed to operate between Q=5 and Q=10. Gain grows exponentially due to increasing heat produced by the reaction, so beyond Q=10 it is not a big leap to reach Q=infinity. Fusion triple product measures efficiency of the plasma in producing fusion reactions. The triple product is calculated by multiplying temperature, density, and confinement time. The JT-60 tokamak in Japan holds the record for highest triple product. Plasma duration measures how long the reactor can operate continuously. The W7-X stellerator has the current best plasma duration at 30 minutes. ITER is expected to have a plasma duration of 10 minutes. To summarize the current state, there are reactor designs that are projected to produce net energy, but only for short durations. A working power plant needs to have a plasma duration in days or weeks rather than minutes, so there is still a long way to go.
