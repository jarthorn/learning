## Why fusion?

According to the IEA, 85% of global energy consumption comes from fossil fuels. Renewables are growing but are barely denting the growth rate of energy consumption from oil and natural gas. The world needs to drastically reduce carbon emissions, and fusion power is one of the few energy sources capable of replacing energy from fossil fuels over the long term. The major inputs to fusion reactions are isotopes of hydrogen and lithium, which are either abundant or can be produced onsite. The main by-product of fusion is helium, which is safe. Fusion energy is not a fringe idea: Most industrialized nations have large fusion research programs, and there are a growing number of privately funded fusion startups. Fusion downsides: There is some radioactive waste created in the metals used to confine the reactor, but this waste has a half-life in the 10's of years, rather than 10,000's of years for fission waste. Fusion technology is already proven, but not yet economically viable. Fusion experiments are vastly complex and can take decades to build and validate. At current funding levels, and without further major breakthroughs, it will likely be at least 30 years until commercial reactors are available. Even if you aren't interested in the future of humanity, fusion research is a deeply fascinating world of science and engineering problems that is worth exploring for the sheer nerd value. 

## How does Fusion work?

Fusion is a reaction that combines two or more nuclei to form a new nucleus. If the outputs of the reaction has less mass than the inputs, the difference is released as energy. From Einstein's equation we know the a small mass translates into a large amount of energy. A very simple fusion reaction powers our sun and other stars, where two hydrogen nuclei fuse to form one helium nucleus, generating heat and light. This reaction requires the high pressure of a star's gravity to induce, but there are other fusion reactions we can reproduce more easily on earth. The easiest fusion reaction to produce combines hydrogen-2 (deuterium), hydrogen-3 (tritium), and lithium-7, to produce helium and a free neutron. This reaction is often referenced by the shorthand D-T. Other reactions are possible and there is active research into the best approach, but D-T is the most viable option today. To trigger fusion, the fuel needs to be heated to millions or even 100M degrees. Once fusion starts, the reaction itself produces heat, so that vastly less or theoretically no external heating is required to sustain it.

## What are the major categories of fusion reactors?

## Is it safe?

## Can it be used for war?

Hydrogen bombs make use of nuclear fusion to magnify their destructive power. However, these bombs still use fission as the initial reaction required to produce the heat required to cause a fusion reaction to occur. Magnetic confinement does not have practical military applications. Inertial confinement involves use of massive lasers. These lasers could have military applications separate from their use in fusion reactions.

## How close are we to reaching practical use for energy production?

European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) has a roadmap that aims to reach an economically viable power plant by 2050. Some fusion startups have projections of usable fusion reactors in 2030's.
